# JR-MULTIPLIER-VERIFICATION

In This repository, you'll find a example of verification flow I might take for a bigger design. I have verified a 4-bit synchronous multiplier using a full testbench in System Verilog.
This was more for demonstration rather than practicality. If you have any questions, the code is fully commented. 

Below, you will find a screenshot of part of the output I obtained from Xilinx Vivado.
